Kindergarten</h1>
<p>The Junior School has a dynamic environment in which leads to significant development in physical, emotional and intellectual growth. These are the 'Foundation Years' during which early linguistic skills, creative play, physical fitness and social skills are inculcated. This is the phase when a sense of identity takes shape. </p>
<p>Students of Kindergarten develop fine motor skills, auditory visual discrimination, hand-eye co-ordination, one-to-one correspondence and logical thinking. Activities are conducted to enhance children observation skills, quantitative analysis and sequencing. </p>
<p>In Kindergarten more emphasis is given on reading which helps to increase the vocabulary of students. Children start framing simple sentences, which brings out their creative writing skills. Mathematics and Science are dealt with interactive sessions where discussions from the child are encouraged and emphasized. Craft activities, storytelling, poetry recitation, singing, drama and dance, are a part of the Kindergarten programme. </p>

The Primary School Grade 1 - 5</h1>
<p>As primary schooling is a time of multi-dimensional learning, we begin to introduce them progressively to the world of integrated knowledge, while particularly strengthening their aptitude in the core studies of English, Mathematics, General Science, and Social Science. </p>
<p>A wide range of classroom activities are used as stimuli for reading and writing. Appreciating the fact that computer literacy is essential in a modern world, our students are introduced to computers from class 1 to sharpen their analytical skills. Children also start using the Math Lab from Class 1. We encourage students in the primary school to do various projects in Environmental Science appreciating the cultural diversity, History and Geography of our planet. Physical training classes are conducted to develop their agility and fitness. Art and music classes create an awareness and appreciation of these creative forms </p>
<p>Establishing worthwhile work habits, persistence, independence, time management, and an appreciation for value of learning by oneself begins early in the schooling process atPreethi Public School. </p>

The Senior School Grade 9 - 10</h1>
<p> As students progress through the senior years, we expect them to become increasingly independent learners with an interest in setting personal academic goals. It is our belief that rigorous and regular testing provides young students with the self-discipline and confidence to handle more advanced senior tasks. We seek to reinforce in our students the qualities of self-esteem, self-respect and the courage to explore</p>
