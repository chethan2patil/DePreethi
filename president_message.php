<p style="text-align:justify;">De Preethi Public School’s academic ethos focuses on encouraging the  
students to utilise their talents, and develop their intellectual and creative interests so that they remain 
interesting and interested young men for the rest of their professional and personal lives. The Pupils need to
 understand their own culture and history, as well as their own geographical, scientific and spiritual theory and
 language. The school’s academic environment is constructed such that the student are able to develop their knowledge
 and interest in these areas in an international context and around the global world in which they are born and will live.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Students at De Preethi Public School are expected to be independent thinkers, 
develop first class critical reading, writing and analysis skills, learn to understand the value of research across 
all areas of the curriculum and be self-motivated and self-driven through a genuine love of the subject and not only
 by intrinsic rewards. Students should be aware of their weaknesses and strengths and be able to develop an
 understanding for them. Service and an understanding of each other’s cultural backgrounds and religions
 is a crucial aspect of academic and wider life at De Preethi Public School.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">De Preethi Public School, Chintamani is a highly successful and soaring high.
 We have outstanding students and our aim is to provide an outstanding education for each and every one of them.
 My aim is to lead a school where the students are able to flourish academically and socially and be part of a rich,
 vibrant and diverse community.  We believe that education can transform lives and our school aims to inspire the children to be curious learners, who are confident to think creatively, 
underpinned by values of honesty, integrity and a sense of social justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Our teachers know their students well and encourage each pupil to reach their full potential and achieve their aspirations.  We want every student here to have the opportunity to learn about themselves, the world and to shape and develop the role they will play in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are a busy, caring and supportive school which values praise, enjoyment, respect and honesty in all we do.   A rich programme of extra curricular provision provides chances for the students to develop outside of the classroom, particularly in skills of confidence, teamwork and leadership.
Life at DE PREETHI CBSE is a seamless journey  and the experiences gained will have a lasting value.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We aim to develop young adults who leave the school with a secure sense of identity, a respect, tolerance for and understanding of difference and diversity, academic success and as well-rounded, confident young people who are ready and able to embrace the challenges and opportunities of adult life.</p>
