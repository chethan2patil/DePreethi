<h1>Our Mission</h1>
</div>
<div class="teacher-item col-sm-8 teacher-about-row">
<p>It is on a mission to mould and shape students into confident leadership who will drive change in the future. Give your child, watch them grow and blossom  and will give your child creators and innovators.</p>
<p>Your Time at De Preethi's 
525,600. That’s 365 (days) times 24 (hours in a day) times 60 (minutes in an hour): a whole year’s worth of minutes.</p>
<p>
As a De Preethi’s student, you’ll fill those minutes doing Maths, science, social science   and learning English . You’ll fill them playing in a Various team and starring in the play and making friends for life. You’ll fill them expanding your mind, opening your heart, filling your soul. You’ll fill them painting your face red, or green. And then you’ll do it all over again.
